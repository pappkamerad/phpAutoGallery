# The latest version of phpAutoGallery can be obtained from:
# http://sourceforge.net/projects/phpautogallery
#
# $Id$
#
# Usage:
# This is the required mod_rewrite configuration for phpAutoGallery.
# Change <GALLERY_WEB_PATH> to the full url path of your 
# root gallery folder. (and where the __phpAutoGallery folder must
# be located)
#
# Example 1:
# if your gallery is accessible here:
# "http://www.example.com/mygallery"
# then <GALLERY_WEB_PATH> would be "/mygallery"
# and the rewrite-rule would look like this:
# "RewriteRule .* /mygallery/__phpAutoGallery/wrapper.php [NE,QSA,L]"
#
# Example 2:
# or your gallery is accessible in the webroot directly:
# "http://www.example.com"
# then <GALLERY_WEB_PATH> would be "" (empty)
# and the rewrite-rule would look like this:
# "RewriteRule .* /__phpAutoGallery/wrapper.php [NE,QSA,L]"
#
# Then copy this file to the root path of your gallery and rename
# it to '.htaccess' (default for the Apache 'AccessFileName' directive)
#
# If you have problems with the loading, you may try
# to add this line:
# RewriteBase <GALLERY_WEB_PATH>
#
RewriteEngine on

RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !.*__phpAutoGallery/wrapper\.php.*
RewriteRule .* <GALLERY_WEB_PATH>/__phpAutoGallery/wrapper.php [NE,QSA,L]
