# This is the required mod_rewrite configuration for phpAutoGallery.
# Change <FULL_GALLERY_PATH> to the full filesystem path of your 
# root gallery folder. (and where the __phpAutoGallery folder must
# be located)
# Then copy this file to the root path of your gallery and rename
# it to '.htaccess' (default for the Apache 'AccessFileName' directive)
#
# Example:
# RewriteRule .* /usr/local/apache/htdocs/mygallery/__phpAutoGallery/wrapper.php [NE,QSA,L]
