phpAutoGallery

Installation
============

  Requirements:
    - PHP >= 4.0.6+, (tested with 4.3.3) with GD support
      (Note: imagecopymerge() doesn't work correct in PHP 4.3.2 - BugID: 24816.
       So overlaying of a logo image may not work correct with this version of PHP)
    - mod_rewrite

  Recommendations:
  	- GD >= 2.0.1 (for high-quality resizing of the images)

  Preface:
    If your using the .htaccess file make sure that you are allowed to
    override the necessary server configurations.
    Apache: "AllowOverride FileInfo" - must be set at least.
    
  Quick Install:
    1. Untar the distribution (be sure to untar the subdirectories)
       tar -xzvf phpAutoGallery-x.x.x.tar.gz to the directory in your
       webroot where you like the gallery to be.
       The distribution consists of a htaccess file (with mod_rewrite
       rules) and the "__phpAutoGallery" folder. Both must reside in the
       root gallery folder.
       (Note: DO NOT rename the "__phpAutoGallery" folder)
    2. Rename the htaccess-dist file to ".htaccess"
       (default for the Apache "AccessFileName" directive)
    3. Edit the ".htaccess" file:
       Change <FULL_GALLERY_PATH> to the full filesystem path of your
       root gallery folder.
       (Example: RewriteRule .* /usr/local/apache/htdocs/mygallery/__phpAutoGallery/wrapper.php [NE,QSA,L])
       --
       Alternatively you can put the mod_rewrite rules in a your
       Apache conf file. (e.g. <VirtualHost> or <Directory> context)
       --
    4. Have a look at the config/config.inc.php file and adjust
       some settings if you like/need to.
       At least make sure that the $cfg['tmp_path'] is ok for your
       system. (default should be ok for linux servers)
       
    5. Put some pictures / create folders in your root gallery folder.
       See if everything works fine by open your gallery in your browser.
       (<www.your-host.com>/<your-install-dir>)
