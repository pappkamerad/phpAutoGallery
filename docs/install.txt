phpAutoGallery

Installation
============

  Requirements:
    - PHP >= 4.0.6+, (tested with 4.3.3) with GD support
      (Note: imagecopymerge() doesn't work correct in PHP 4.3.2 - BugID: 24816.
       So overlaying of a logo image may not work correct with this version of PHP)
    - apache with mod_rewrite
    
  Recommendations:
  	- GD >= 2.0.1 (for high-quality resizing of the images)

  Preface:
	If your using the .htaccess file make sure that you are allowed to
    override the necessary server configurations.
    Apache: "AllowOverride FileInfo" - must be set at least.
    
  Install:
	1. Untar the distribution (be sure to untar the subdirectories)
       tar -xzvf phpAutoGallery-x.x.x.tar.gz to a directory named 
       "__phpAutoGallery" (without the quotes) in your
       webroot where you like the gallery to be.
       The distribution consists of a htaccess file (with mod_rewrite
       rules) and the "__phpAutoGallery" folder. Both must reside in the
       root gallery folder.
       (Note: DO NOT use another name for the "__phpAutoGallery" folder)
    
    2. Copy the htaccess-dist file one directory up. (to the root gallery folder)
    
    2. Rename the htaccess-dist file to ".htaccess"
       (default for the Apache "AccessFileName" directive)
       
       Directory-layout should be something like this:
	   /path/to/docroot/mygallery/
	   /path/to/docroot/mygallery/__phpAutoGallery/
	   /path/to/docroot/mygallery/.htaccess
	   /path/to/docroot/mygallery/somepicture.jpg
	   /path/to/docroot/mygallery/some picture folder
	   /path/to/docroot/mygallery/some picture folder/another_picture.jpg
	   ... etc ...
    
    3. Edit the ".htaccess" file:
	   Change <GALLERY_WEB_PATH> to the full url path of your 
	   root gallery folder. (and where the __phpAutoGallery folder must
	   be located)

	   Example 1:
	   if your gallery is accessible here:
	   "http://www.example.tld/mygallery"
	   then <GALLERY_WEB_PATH> would be "/mygallery"
	   and the rewrite-rule would look like this:
	   "RewriteRule .* /mygallery/__phpAutoGallery/wrapper.php [NE,QSA,L]"

	   Example 2:
	   or your gallery is accessible in the webroot directly:
	   "http://www.example.tld"
	   then <GALLERY_WEB_PATH> would be "" (empty)
	   and the rewrite-rule would look like this:
	   "RewriteRule .* /__phpAutoGallery/wrapper.php [NE,QSA,L]"
       
       If you have problems with the loading, you may try
	   to add this line:
	   "RewriteBase <GALLERY_WEB_PATH>"
       
       --
       Alternatively you can put the mod_rewrite rules in your
       Apache conf file. (e.g. <VirtualHost> or <Directory> context)
       --
    
    4. Have a look at the config/config.inc.php file and adjust
       some settings if you like/need to.
       At least take a look at $cfg['tmp_path']. Verify that it exsits and
       that the apache user has write permissions in that folder.
       
       IMPORTANT: Also change the username and password for the admin interface!
       $cfg['admin']['username']
	   $cfg['admin']['password']

	5. Also have a look at the template specific template_config.inc.php file, located
	   in templates/<TEMPLATE_NAME>/config/.
	   Individial template-settings are stored in this file.

    5. Put some pictures / create folders in your root gallery folder.
       See if everything works fine by open your gallery in your browser.
       (<www.your-host.com>/<your-install-dir>)
       
       i.e. for the above mentioned example the URL would be:
       "http://www.example.tld/mygallery/"
       
    6. If everything works right, you can access a little admin interface
       at this URL:
       "http://<FULL_GALLERY_URL>/__phpAutoGallery__admin"
       
       i.e. for the above mentioned example the URL would be:
       "http://www.example.tld/mygallery/__phpAutoGallery__admin"
       
       (NOTE: "__phpAutoGallery__admin" does NOT have to exist on your server.
       It is just a special name, that wrapper.php can recognise and act accordingly.)
    
       If the currently used template is configured to show a admin-link on every page, than you can access
       the admin interface any time, by just clicking the link.
       
  Cheers,
