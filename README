  for more details.

  Requirements: 
    - PHP >= 4.0.6+, (tested with 4.3.3) with GD support
      (Note: imagecopymerge() doesn't work correct in PHP 4.3.2 - BugID: 24816.
       So overlaying of a logo image may not work correct with this version of PHP)
    - apache with mod_rewrite
    
  Recommendations:
  	- GD >= 2.0.1 (for high-quality resizing of the images)
    
  Summary:
    Just upload your photos and pictures to a gallery folder
    on a webserver and phpAutoGallery will do the rest.
    Point your webbrowser to a path in your gallery:
    http://yourgallery.example.com/lastvacation
    or directly to a certain picture:
    http://yourgallery.example.com/lastvacation/my_babe.jpg
    and the request will transparently be forwarded to phpAutoGallery.
    
  Current Features:
    - application fully transparent to gallery-enduser
    - auto creating and caching of thumbnails and resized images
    - nice directory listings
    - configurable view sizes for fullsize-image-display
    - information about imagefiles and directories
    - automatically puts a copyright/logo-image on the displayed pictures (if you want)
    - uses smarty templates. maximum freedom in customizing the layout

  Credits:
  	This work was inspired by Apache::Gallery by Michael Legart
  	A auto-indexing gallery written as a mod_perl module.
  	I used it for a long time now, but wanted to write and use such a software in PHP.
