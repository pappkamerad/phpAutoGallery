  Requirements: 
    - PHP >= 4.0.6+, (tested with 4.3.3) with GD support
      (Note: imagecopymerge() doesn't work correct in PHP 4.3.2 - BugID: 24816.
       So overlaying of a logo image may not work correct with this version of PHP)
    - apache with mod_rewrite
    
  Recommendations:
  	- GD >= 2.0.1 (for high-quality resizing of the images)
    
  Summary:
    Just upload your photos and pictures to a gallery folder
    on a webserver and phpAutoGallery will do the rest.
    Point your webbrowser to a path in your gallery:
    http://yourgallery.example.com/lastvacation
    or directly to a certain picture:
    http://yourgallery.example.com/lastvacation/my_babe.jpg
    and the request will transparently be forwarded to phpAutoGallery.
    
  Current Features:
  - Application fully transparent to gallery-enduser
  - On-the-fly creation and caching of thumbnails, resized fullsize images, directory listings
  - Configurable view sizes for fullsize-image display
  - Overlaying of Copyright/Logo images on-the-fly.
  - Displays information about imagefiles and directories.
  - Easy to setup.
  - Fully customizable through the use of Smarty templates.
  - Folder- and picture-descriptions
  - Admin-interface
